# TODO

## NOW

The Oxford [honorific?] pause
specs subspecs and blocks
specs, subspecs, and blocks
specs and subspecs, and blocks
specs, subspecs, and blocks, and, blocks and comments

- [ ] add comments and community tagging
	- [ ] arbitrary plaintext/markdown comments on specs, subspecs, and blocks
	- [ ] arbitrary community tags on blocks and comments with community assent/dissent per tag
	- [ ] community modal with comment filtering interface
	- [ ] pinned tags (on block, for block community space comments, on comment)

## NEXT

- minor stuff
	- [ ] delete block from within edit modal

- [ ] bulk move blocks, move across subspec contexts

- [ ] add user admin function

- [ ] soft delete option

- [ ] users collapse blocks (persist state to db for individual user)

- [ ] other specs, other specs' subspecs as ref types

- [ ] add spec changelog for historical re-rendering

- [ ] attribute tags? "magic tags"
	- tags that change behaviour of block
	- tags that specify a value for an attribute
		- all value candidates proposed as separate tags
		- attribute may be pinned with "attr:" to appear in collapsed / summary tag listing with the value most supported
		- individual values may be pinned for the same attribute

- support [only named?] HTML character entities in titles

- support voting on fragments within block titles and bodies, and comments

- [fragment?] may become [fragment] automatically after a threshold support ratio

- may expand on that with optional path trees flattened / rendered into single bodies of text, fragments with subfragments, alternatives for any span with their own distinct [or shared (referenced in the source by ID?)] subfragments; may have logic embedded in source text that indicates which fragment to show or which tag to dynamically choose a fragment alternative by

- [ ] maintenance mode 503

- [ ] display dependencies' licenses on site
