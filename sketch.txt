find policy element ("expand policy"):
-- looks for the outermost policy that specifies the value for a policy element
iterate conditional policies from last up
	if conditions match, expand policy
if self policy element defined, return
expand base policy

expand tags ("expand policy"):
-- travels up inheritance compiling tags
-- from all inheritance pathways and matching conditional policies
add base expand policy to return
add self tags to return
iterate conditional policies from first down
	if conditions match, add expand policy to return
only add tags that haven't already been added
return

subs policy does not inherit parent context unless refers to it as base
parent context may be vastly expanded before finding subs policy

step up from post to nearest policy
step down levels finding subs or inheriting parent until reaching post


comment policy
step up to nearest policy (stack)
step down to comment through subs and comments policies,
evaluating policy for comments policy at each step,
carrying parent comments policy from within stack if none defined;
and output comments policy for comment

block policy
step up to nearest policy (stack)
step down to block through subs policies,
evaluating policy for subs at east step,
carrying parent policy from within stack if no subs specified at any step;
and output policy for block


-- subspec inherits spec policy by defaults
-- (spec/subspec container types most likely represented by same root policy)
-- subs applies to sub blocks
or
-- subspec inherts subs policy of spec policy like a block
-- pinned tags activate different conditional policies for subspecs and blocks




traverse blocks through subs, and then comments through comments;
subs policy cuts off when entering comments;
comments policy must be specified on policy applying to last block;
same occurs at spec/subspec to blocks and to comments boundaries;
block policy is inherited from parent block if no subs policy specified;
comments policy is inherited from parent comment if no comments policy specified;
also supported to refer such policies to themselves,
and the step routine must be intelligent about not re-evaluating the same policy
on each step in such scenarios.
